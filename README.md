# Dragonfly diversity informatics to achieve ecological assessments 
* Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are freshwater insects that are used as ecological indicators in ecological assessments.Many amateurs post dragonfly images for identification purposes on social media platforms such as Facebook. 
* We are creating a pipeline to bring about biodiversity Informatics mediated by <b> social media, an AI-based app for taxonomy, and a checklist app for reporting dragonfly ecological data </b>, involving layman and citizens as stakeholders. With our tools and apps citizens can record dragonfly data that can be used in research, conservation, and education.  
## Task 1 [Get Data & EDA]
* Here we mine data from Facebook (DragonflySouthAsia)
* Get Species Name, Common Name, Location, Date from the Description in the Caption of every Post.
* Then we proceed to perform spatio-temporal analysis.
### Analysis

#### Distribution of observation across the country at district-level.
